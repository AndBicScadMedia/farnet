#summary View/Edit/Save/SELect - Smart file history tools

== Introduction ==

Vessel (short for View/Edit/Save/SELect) is the FarNet module for Far
Manager. It records and maintains history of file view, edit, and save
operations and provides related tools.

Features

 * smart and plain history lists
 * Incremental filter (no need for CtrlAltF)
 * Reduced noise (e.g. excluded temporary files)
 * For other features see history lists help (F1)

If the log file is missing then it is generated from the existing Far history.
This history is not yet effective for training. The smart history list will be
the same as the plain list for some time even after training.

The smart history list shows files in heuristically improved order. Recently
used files are sorted by last times, as usual. Files not used for a while are
sorted by ranks. Rank is based on last time, frequency, activity, and factors
calculated by training.

How training works. For every file record it builds the plain history list and
several ranked lists with different factors. The list with the file nearest to
the top wins. Finally the factors that maximize the total difference between
the plain and ranked lists for all records are taken.

Automatic fast training starts after updating the history file from the menu
and after opening not recent files from the smart history. It works in the
background and it is very fast (~50 times faster than full training).
