== Windows PowerShell ==

Windows PowerShell is Microsoft's task automation framework, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language built on top of, and integrated with, the .NET Framework. PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems.

== PowerShell syntax highlighting with Colorer ==

[http://farnet.googlecode.com/files/demo-colorer.htm Here] is an example of PowerShell syntax highlighting in a very convoluted demo script. This is a HTML page generated by the Colorer console utility. But it also shows exactly how the Far Manager internal editor and the Colorer plug-in highlight the same script.

Required `powershell.hrc` (syntax scheme) and `visual.hrd` (optional color scheme) come with the plugin Colorer.
