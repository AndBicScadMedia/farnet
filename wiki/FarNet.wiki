#summary Far Manager SDK for .NET modules and Windows PowerShell scripts

== Introduction ==

FarNet is Far Manager .NET API and runtime infrastructure for .NET modules. It exposes Far Manager API in comfortable object oriented way and does most of the low level routine jobs for its modules. Modules normally contain only tiny pieces of boilerplate framework code.

The important member of the FarNet family is the PowerShellFar module.
It implements Windows PowerShell host in Far Manager, user interface for invoking
commands and scripts, and exposes underlying FarNet object model. The package
includes scripts for many popular Far Manager tasks and PowerShell.hrc for
Colorer providing rich PowerShell syntax highlighting.
