#summary Debugger for Graphical PowerShell V2 CTP2

= Introduction =

[NOTE:  PowerShell V2 CTP3 introduces next version of Graphical PowerShell which is called PowerShell ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment). This version implements the debugger itself, so that Utility_GPowerShellDebugger is not really needed any more.]

*Graphical PowerShell V2 CTP2* still looks like a demo, basically speaking. Nevertheless, it is already suitable for some tasks. Unfortunately it does not implement a few host features including default breakpoint debugger action. Breakpoints without action are simply ignored. Fortunately PowerShell provides a way to solve this. Here it is: simple and yet practically useful *Add-Debugger.ps1*.
