#summary Debugger for Graphical PowerShell V2 CTP2

= Introduction =

*Graphical PowerShell V2 CTP2* still looks like a demo, basically speaking. Nevertheless, it is already suitable for some tasks. Unfortunately it does not implement a few host features including default breakpoint debugger action. Breakpoints without action are simply ignored. Fortunately PowerShell provides a way to solve this. Here it is: simple and yet practically useful *Add-Debugger.ps1*.

= Details =

Dowload *Utility_GPowerShellDebugger*. The archive contains the main script *Add-Debugger.ps1* and also *Test-Debugger.ps1* to play with and see how debugging goes (in any host, actually). Follow instructions in the script headers.
