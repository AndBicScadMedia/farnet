#summary Where to get released packages

== New Downloads ==

releases are distributed as NuGet packages. This way may look unusual but it
has many advantages with various supportive tools.

FarNet packages and other tools released by the author can be found at 
[https://www.nuget.org/profiles/nightroman NuGet Gallery].
