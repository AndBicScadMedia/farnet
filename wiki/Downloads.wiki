== New Downloads ==

As far as Google Code does not support new downloads starting 2014-01-15, new
releases are distributed as NuGet packages. This way may look unusual but it
has many advantages with various supportive tools.

FarNet packages and other tools released by the author can be found at this
[https://www.nuget.org/profiles/nightroman NuGet Gallery page].

The simplest way to get, unpack, install, or update Far Manager NuGet packages is the PowerShell script
[https://farnet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/PowerShellFar/Bench/Update-FarPackage.ps1 Update-FarPackage.ps1]

If you download the script, i.e. not copy/paste, then do RMB > Properties >
Unblock. Example command in PowerShell:

{{{
	Update-FarPackage <PackageID> -FarHome <FarDirectory>
}}}

----

Alternatively, packages can be downloaded and unpacked by various NuGet tools,
for example [http://nuget.org/nuget.exe NuGet.exe]. Package files are located
in the unpacked sub-directory tools. They are be copied manually as described
in package manuals. Example command in CMD:

{{{
	NuGet install <PackageID>
}}}
