#summary Some editor actions work like in other editors

== Introduction ==

This tool allows to alter some operations in editors, edit controls, and the
command line. They are: Step/Select/Delete by words, Go/Select to smart home.
New actions are similar to what many popular editors do on stepping, selecting,
deleting by words, and etc. Example: Visual Studio editor, Word, WordPad, etc.

All the module commands work via the macro function callplugin().

Word commands:
{{{
	step-left
	step-right
	select-left
	select-right
	delete-left
	delete-right
	vertical-left
	vertical-right
}}}
Smart home commands:
{{{
	go-to-smart-home
	select-to-smart-home
}}}

Example macro for the Editor area:
{{{
	callplugin(0xcd, "RightControl:go-to-smart-home")
}}}

The included PowerShellFar script Install-RightControlMacro-.ps1 installs the
typical macros, see its comments.

Until the issue Mantis 1465 is resolved Shift+Left/Right work funny in dialogs
and the cmdline when selection is set by the module. Workaround: use macros
ShiftLeft/Right (not in editor!) and bind them to the commands vertical-left
and vertical-right. (Install-RightControlMacro-.ps1 does this, too).
