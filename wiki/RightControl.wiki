#summary Some editor actions work like in other editors

== Introduction ==

This tool allows to alter some operations in editors, edit controls, and the
command line. They are: Step/Select/Delete by words, Go/Select to smart home.
New actions are similar to what many popular editors do on stepping, selecting,
deleting by words, and etc. Example: Visual Studio editor, Word, WordPad, etc.

The module shows its menu items in Editor, Dialog, and Panel menus. These menus
can be used for key macros. The included script Install-RightControlMacro-.ps1
(requires PowerShellFar) installs the typical macros, see comments there.

Known issue/workaround:
Until the issue Mantis 1465 is resolved Shift+Left/Right work funny in dialogs
and the cmdline when selection is set by the module. Workaround: use macros
ShiftLeft/Right (not in editor!) and bind them to the commands 7 and 8.
(Install-RightControlMacro-.ps1 installs that macros, too).
