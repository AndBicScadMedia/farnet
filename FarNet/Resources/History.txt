3.3.7

- Created CHM help: from now on the latest version can be downloaded from:
http://code.google.com/p/farnet/downloads/list
- IFar: two new methods Write() appending plain or colored text to the user
screen (under panels).
- Far.NET does not show now error message boxes during the procedure of loading
plugins (it is annoying if problems are known and temporary). Instead, it writes
all error messages to the user screen and continues.

3.3.6

- Removed: IMenuItem.Selected and related IMenu.Show(int) and parameters
Selected from several methods IMenuItems.Add(). Instead, IMenu.Show() uses
IMenu.Selected as input if it is set. This way seems more consistent than
approach with IMenuItem.Selected (potential conflict between items).

3.3.5

- ILine.Pos: setting of a negative value moves cursor to the end of a line.
- New ILine.Length: text length; use it when text itself is irrelevant.
- New IEditor.GoEnd(): effective way to move cursor to the end of file.
- IFar.Msg(): header: chars '\t', '\r', '\n', if any, are replaced with spaces.
- Removed FarPluginsLoader.dll; you have to do it manually (in %FARHOME%\Lib).
- Fixed recent bugs in menus.
- New property IMenu.SelectLast: tells to select the last item.
- New IMenu feature: filters. See XML docs for properties Filter, FilterKey,
FilterHistory, FilterRestore.

- Interfaces IRect, IStream, ITwoPoints are replaced with value type with
neutral name Place which can be used as Rect, Stream or TwoPoints.
- New properties HelpTopic in IDialog, IMenu, IInputBox, IMessage and new method
IFar.ShowHelp().
- Removed FarDotNetStruct.dll; you should remove it manually if you have one,
normally it is in here: "%FARHOME%\Lib\".

3.3.3

- New editor methods Begin()\End(). They drastically improve performance of
operations on large number of editor lines. Example: an operation used to take
2-3 minutes on a file containing 40,000 lines; now being used with Begin\End it
takes 4 seconds.
- Interface ICursor is replaced with struct TextFrame + related properties
Frame, Cursor and methods GoTo*.

the screen.

3.3.1

- New dialog item IComboBox, IListBox, password editor and vertical text or
separator.
- Implemented main dialog events. See Test-Dialog-.ps1 in PowerShellFar 1.1.1
for examples.
- Most of dialog items properties are dynamic, i.e. when a dialog is started
they reflect the current dialog state both for reading and writing. Example:
Test-Dialog-.ps1 - button [Test] and related code.
- IFar.Msg(): supported line delimiters are \r, \n и \r\n, Tabs are replaced
with spaces. Text is wrapped if required. Two new methods IFar.Msg() with more
options.
- Revision of old Key, Mouse and related events. New structs are KeyInfo and
MouseInfo.

Test-Dialog-.ps1 in PowerShellFar 1.1.0.
- New method IFar.CreateViewer() and interface IViewer.
- New method IFar.WriteText().
- Revision of IInputBox.
- IFar.PostText() processes \n, \r and \r\n as Enter. Empty text and empty key
sequence for IFar.PostKeys() is not an error.
- Optimized some string operations.

3.2.9
