<pp name="AddLookup">
<summary>
Adds a lookup handler.
</summary>
<param name="name">Name of a <see cref="ListPanel"/> file.</param>
<param name="handler">Handler of [Enter] on a file.</param><remarks>
<para>
These handles are used by <see cref="ListPanel"/> but often they are added to
<see cref="TablePanel"/> and then internally passed in its child <see cref="ListPanel"/>.
</para>
<para>
Example: if this is a <see cref="DataPanel"/> then the added handler will be called when
[Enter] is pressed on its child <see cref="MemberPanel"/> file with the specified name.
Normally the task of this handler is to start another table containing values to be selected
and to set a handler triggered on [Enter] there (see <see cref="SetLookup"/>).
Example script: <c>Test-Panel-DbNotes-.ps1</c>.
