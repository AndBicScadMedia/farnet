SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Far Manager file description tools.
    Author: Roman Kuzmin

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Though this module is designed for Far Manager it does not depend on it or
    even on FarNet, it works in any PowerShell host (e.g. in Console or ISE).

MODULE SETTINGS
    The module settings are similar to Far Manager description settings but
    they are defined separately in the module script `FarDescription.psm1`:

        [FarDescription.Settings]::ListNames = 'Descript.ion', 'Files.bbs'
        [FarDescription.Settings]::AnsiByDefault = $false
        [FarDescription.Settings]::SaveInUTF = $true
        [FarDescription.Settings]::SetHidden = $true

    Changes in the module script are not recommended. In order to change these
    settings consider to use a wrapper script that imports this module and then
    sets the settings.

EXPORTED COMMANDS
    -- Update-FarDescription (cmdlet)
    -- Update-FarDescriptionSynopsis (function)

EXTENDED TYPES
    The module adds a few members to the [System.IO.FileSystemInfo] items
    (files or directories, items of the FileSystem provider).
