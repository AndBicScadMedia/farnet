SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Far Manager macro provider and tools.

LONG DESCRIPTION

CMDLETS
	Use Get-FarHelp to get more details about the cmdlets.
    =================================================================

	Edit-FarMacro

	Opens the editor with the macro sequence. Syntax highlighting should work
	if the Colorer plugin is used. On saving, if syntax is valid, the macro is
	installed and ready to use. On syntax errors an error message is shown and
	the cursor is set to the error position. On exit, if syntax is not valid,
	you are prompted to continue or discard the changes. NOTE: in this way you
	only edit the sequence, other macro options remains default for a new macro
	and not changed for an existing.

	There are three modes, depending on parameter sets:
	-- Macro : -Macro; based on a macro object;
	-- Name  : -Name, -Area; existing or a new macro by names;
	-- File  : -FilePath; based on an existing or a new macro file.

	The File mode simply edits the file and checks syntax on saving.

    =================================================================

	New-FarMacro

	Creates a new macro instance with empty or default option values.

    =================================================================

	Set-FarMacro

PROVIDERS
    The module includes the FarMacro provider. The FarMacro provider lets you
    view the macros in PowerShell as though they were on a file system drive.

    The FarMacro provider exposes the FarMacro: drive. To go into the FarMacro:
    drive, type:

	Set-Location FarMacro:

    To view the contents of the drive, type:

	Get-ChildItem

    To view the contents of the drive from another Windows PowerShell drive,
    begin the path with the drive name. For example:

	Get-ChildItem FarMacro:

    To get macros in a particular area, type the drive name and the area name.

	Get-ChildItem FarMacro:\Shell
